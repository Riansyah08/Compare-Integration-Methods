# 🧮 Compare Integration Methods – Final Project for Numerical Method
This repository contains our **University Final Project** for the **Numerical Method** course, developed by a group of three students using **Python**.
<br><br>

### 📌 Project Overview
In this project, we created a Python program that:
- 🔣 Accepts a **user-defined mathematical function**
- 📐 Computes the **definite integral** of the function over a specified interval
- 🔁 Implements and compares two numerical integration methods:
   - **Midpoint Rule**
   - **Trapezoid Rule**
- 🎯 Determines **which method converges faster** to a known true value within a defined **tolerance**
<br><br>

### 💻 Technologies Used
- Python 3.13
- PyCharm or VSCode or other supported compiler
<br><br>

### 🚀 Key Features
- ✅ User input for function and interval
- ✅ Numerical approximation using two methods
- ✅ Error analysis and comparison
- ✅ Outputs the more efficient method based on convergence rate
<br><br>

### 🧪 How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3.13 is installed on your system
2. Run the script
3. Follow the input prompts to:
   - Enter a function (e.g., sin(x))
   - Define interval (a to b)
   - Enter the true value of the integral (if known)
   - Enter the tolerance for error (e.g., 1e-4)
   - Set number of subintervals and tolerance
